I've solved _many_ CTF challenges over the years -- not all got a writeup, but I'm working to change that going forward.

## My CTF Story
I started playing wargames ([IO](https://io.netgarage.org) specifically) back in 2010 or so. When I attended [UCF](http://ucf.edu) I started playing full time with [KnightSec](https://ctftime.org/team/2500) in August of 2012. I played with them until 2015 when I graduated, moved to [UF](http://ufl.edu) for my PhD, and joined up with [Kernel Sanders](https://ctftime.org/team/397).

* **Previous Team**: KnightSec (2012 - 2015)
* **Current Team**: Kernel Sanders (2015 - present)
